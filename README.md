# gatsby-plugin-download-google-fonts

A Gatsby plugin to download and prefetch [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Can increase performance as opposed to loading webfonts from Google's external stylesheet.

## Installation

With npm:

```bash
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-download-google-fonts
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add gatsby-plugin-download-google-fonts
```

## Usage

In your `gatsby-config.js` file, load in the plugin along with which web fonts to load.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
			resolve: `download-google-fonts`,
			options: {
				fonts: [
					{
						family: `Oswald`,
						subsets: [`latin`],
					},
					{
            family: `Open Sans`,
            variants: [`400`, `700`]
					},
				],
			},
		}
  ]
}
```
